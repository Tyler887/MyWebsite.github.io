MyWebsite.github.io is a template for creating GitHub user websites. It supports Markdown and HTML.

``` markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4

*italic*
**bold**
***bold and italic***

`Hello world!`

> Quote


@github

```

If you don't like Markdown, and want to design with HTML:
``` html
<h2>Hi!</h2>
My site is built on <a href=https://pages.github.com>GitHub Pages</a>
```



Remember, you can blog on these sites by adding files to a `_posts` directory.

Also, your site's settings use a [config file](./_config.yml)!
  
**But both of these work ONLY if you use Markdown. HTML will not work.**

*Don't disable GitHub Actions else you cannot build and deploy the site if it is disabled.*

Note: You need to replace "MyWebsite" in the repo's name with your GitHub username for this to work, else your site cannot be found in the *root* of your GitHub Pages site.
